# Tomato Timer

A mobile timer for The Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[1]
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[5]
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
